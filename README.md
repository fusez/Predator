# Predator

## What is it?
### This script allows you to launch a remote controlled predator missile from anywhere in SA:MP

## How does it work?
The player that launches the missile enters spectating mode and an actor is placed at the player's position while they are in spectating mode.
If anyone deals damage to this actor the missile strike gets canceled.
All of the players that die within blast radius will count as a kill by the player controlling the missile.
